The 24/7 room initiative plans to make life easier for more casual or easygoing players, where they don't have to awkwardly ask around for games - they just hop into LegacyMGO and play.

# FAQ

Q: When will it be out?
A: TheMrIron2 will be buying a second PS2 solely for LegacyMGO around his birthday, November 14. Expect for some big news updates in November and even some alpha testing for those who are willing to participate (password locked and being played on in private for the first few days) to make sure everything is okay. Then we release it into the wild for a week long open beta run, and if all goes to plan the server should "officially" debut in December.

Q: How can I contact TheMrIron2 about LegacyMGO?
A: Your best shot at contacting the man behind the project, TheMrIron2, is through Discord. He is in the SaveMGO community - if you have any questions fire away at him

Q: Is this all a one man effort?
A: Far from it - this wouldn't be possible without the support of the SaveMGO community and their help. TheMrIron2 would like to thank everybody who played a role in this project, no matter how big (website coding, HoodlumDTX) or how small (many people giving feedback) every one of you is appreciated!
